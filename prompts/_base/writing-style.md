1. The writing style must have a high degree of academic rigor, using accurate, objective, impersonal third-person narration. Prioritize the use of definitions, classifications, causation, and logical relationships to organize information. It is forbidden to use any literary rhetoric (such as personification, parallelism, emotional metaphor, etc.) that does not aim to reveal structure and logic. 
2. Never use markdown headings (#) at any level in your answers, because the heading organization of the generated notes should be fixed. 
3. Mathematical formulas: Write LaTeX with ESCAPED backslashes for JSON compatibility. Example: "$E = mc^2$" is OK, but for fractions write "$\\frac{a}{b}$" (double-escaped). Inline code uses backticks.
4. Mark the most critical terms in bold (**). Use italics (*) to mark the most central and general sentence in a paragraph of multiple sentences. Do not use italics (*) to mark sentences if there are only 3 sentences or less in the paragraph. 
5. The accuracy of the answers is crucial and will serve as the cornerstone of a serious academic knowledge base. Any inaccurate or unsubstantiated information undermines the overall value and credibility of the knowledge base. 
6. It is forbidden to add any opening remarks, epilogue, self-evaluation or any additional explanatory text to the structured content.
